#### 1. What others have already done with the data?
Several analyses and visualizations have been conducted using our dataset, including:
- [Data Analysis & Visualization: Video Game Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-video-game-sales): This work analyzed the Global Video Game Sales dataset using R.

#### 2. Why is your approach original?

#### 3. What source of inspiration do you take? 
Additionally, we draw inspiration from impressive visualization projects across different subjects from previous years:
- [Anime Data Visualization](https://github.com/com-480-data-visualization/com-480-project-worldwideweebz) : This project inspired us to come up with our figure 1, aiming to visualize the genre preference and popularity about the most authoritative game sales in the video game industry.
